# My Awesome Social Network API

## Description
This API was built for a social networking application to allow users to share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. It uses Express.js for routing, has a MongoDB database, the Mongooose ODM, and Day.js to format timestamps. After the application is ran, Insomnia is used to test the routes.

## Installation
Express 4.17.1, Mongoose 7.0.2, Dayjs 1.11.7, and MongoDB

## Usage
To use the application, make sure you have MongoDB installed and properly configured. First, clone the repository. After you have cloned the repository, in your terminal under the directory, run "npm i -s". After that, in your terminal run "npm run start". You can now open Insomnia and check all the different routes!
